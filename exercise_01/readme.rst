1IYT
~~~~
Simple, step restricted geometry optimization of the 1IYT oligopeptide (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1IYT).
This is the Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta-peptide (1-42).

MOPAC runs few geometry steps from the pre-optimized 1IYT structure. 

solvent effect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Program is utilizing the COSMO (Conductor-like Screening Model) method to approximate the effect of a solvent model surrounding the molecule.


visualisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can display the resulting aux-file using fresh Avogadro2 build.
