SOPC phospholipid 
=================

Compute and visualise vibrational frequencies of the SOPC phopholipid.

MOPAC semiemprirical program is utilized for geometry optimization and 
frequency calculations.
Before that quick preoptimization and MOPAC input preparation of SOPC is achieved via Avogadro2 force-field method.

Afterwards, frequencies are displayed from the aux file with the Avogadro2 program.
