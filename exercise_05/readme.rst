DIRAC calculation
=================

Simple DIRAC job with the X2C relativistic Hamiltonian of the open-shell LiH(+) cation.

After the SCF step continues with the relativistic Coupled-Cluster method, which give the correlation energy.

We use very small basis set, Li[4s2p] H[2s], where exponents are from STO-2G.
